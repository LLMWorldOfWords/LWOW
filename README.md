LLM World of Words is a dataset of free associations generated by various large language models (LLMs) including Mistral, LLaMA 3 and Claude Haiku. This project is inspired by the [Small World of Words (SWOW)](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/)[3], which collected human-generated word associations. LWOW aims to create a vast network of word connections produced by AI models, potentially revealing insights into how these models process and link language concepts.


-------

### What are Free Associations?
Free associations are spontaneous mental connections between words or ideas. When presented with a stimulus word, a person (or in this case, an AI model) responds with the first word or concept that comes to mind. These associations reveal mental pathways that connect different concepts, often reflecting underlying patterns of thought, memory, or language structure. For example, given the word "tree," a common free association might be "leaf." These associations reveal mental pathways that connect different concepts, often reflecting underlying patterns of thought, memory, or language structure.

  <figcaption><small><strong>Example of a network of free associations for English speaking toddlers:</strong>  Notice that associations relate with the meaning of concepts and can give rise to communities of words representing meaning contexts. In the above example concepts relative to bath furniture (purple nodes) cluster together away from concepts relative to containers or supports (red nodes).</small></figcaption>

### How can they be used?
In psychology, free associations are a tool to study the mind, linguistic networks, and cognitive processes [1]. They help researchers understand how people mentally organize and access information. In modern cognitive psychology, free association tasks are used to explore semantic memory, creativity, and the ways individuals connect ideas. By mapping these connections, psychologists gain insight into how the mind processes, retrieves, and categorizes information.

### LLMs and Gender Bias: a Free Association Study

Gender biases are different way of reasoning depending on different genders and their related stereotypes. 

To explore gender biases, we used the LWOW dataset to examine how different AI models associate words with gender. We gave the AI models words like "woman" or "man" and looked at what other words they connected to these. We simulated spreading activation processes in the word association networks. The analysis revealed significant differences in activation levels for gender-related targets depending on the prime type, with higher activation for stereotype-consistent pairs. This kind of analysis helps us understand how AI systems might perpetuate gender stereotypes and guides efforts to create fairer, more equitable AI technologies.

## Technical notes
The dataset includes:
- 3,463,500 associations from Humans
- 3,463,500 from LLama3
- 3,463,500 associations from Mistral
- 3,463,500 associations from Claude Haiku
  
These associations were generated either via API or locally, depending on the LLM.

The dataset is modeled after the SWOW English word association norms, using the same 12,282 cue words. Each cue word is repeated 100 times, with 3 responses generated per cue.

For some models, participant profiles from the original [SWOW experiment](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/) were also provided to allow investigation of how well the LLMs could simulate specific demographics[3].

The LLMs were prompted with the following task:
```
"Task:- You will be provided with an input word: write the first 3 words you associate to it separated by a comma.
- No additional output text is allowed.
               
Constraints:
- using the profile is mandatory for the task.
- no carriage return characters are allowed in the answers.
- answers should be as short as possible.
                           
Example:
Input: sea
Output: water,beach,sun"
```
The system prompt was:
```
"You are an agent that writes a single word at a time."
```

The responses was preprocessed and cleaned by considering various steps.

### Validation

The datasets were validated using data from the Semantic Priming Project, which implements a lexical decision task to study semantic priming effects. Spreading activation processes were simulated on the constructed networks, showing significant correlations with human reaction time data.

This validation is based on a simple test: when a word (like "doctor") is linked to a related word (like "nurse"), the related word becomes much more "activated" in the network compared to when it’s paired with an unrelated word (like "tree").
